							<p>
							We are a team of streetwear enthusiasts who have been passionate about the world of hype for as long as we can remember. However, streetwear is an expensive hobby: as our closets got fuller, our wallets got thinner. <b>We needed to a way to fund our passion</b>.
							</br>
							</br>
							Then, about five years ago, we discovered <b>reselling</b>. By buying certain items for the low, waiting for a calculated period of time, and selling them high, we are able to profit. With that money, we could finally buy <b>whatever we want, whenever we want</b>.

							<p>
							Five years later, here we are. Reselling allows us to make more money than we could have ever imagined. With our knowledge navigating the streetwear market, as well as prediction models with <b>data science</b> and <b>artificial intelligence</b>, we accurately predict and obtain the items are going to appreciate.

							<b>We want to make our experience and ability to you available to you</b>. We know that getting into reselling is very difficult, and the steep learning curve has driven many people away. Therefore, we want to <b>streamline the process</b>. This idea serves as the foundation of The Hype Advisor, and the Hype Fund specifically.

							<h2>Our Service</h2>
							<p>A clothing and sneaker-based hedgefund with no barriers to entry.</p>
						</header>
						<p>We are an <b>investing service for streetwear</b> based around reselling. You invest money into us, and we put your capital in the streetwear market. Using our connections and extensive knowledge, we buy items that we predict to be <b>bullish</b>: they increase in resale over time. When we sell the items, we transfer the selling price directly to your PayPal account, minus a small 15% commission fee. During the rare occurrence that the items depreciate, we cover 100% of the loss (even though we don't expect it to occur much anyway)!</p>
