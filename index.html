						<p>
							We are a team of streetwear enthusiasts who have been passionate about the world of hype for as long as we can remember. However, streetwear is an expensive hobby: <b>we needed a way to fund our passion.</b>
							</br>
							</br>
							Then, about five years ago, we discovered reselling. By buying certain items for the low, waiting for a calculated period of time, and selling them high, we were able to profit.

						<p>
							Five years later, here we are. Reselling allows us to make more money than we could have ever imagined. With our knowledge navigating the streetwear market, we accurately predict and obtain the items that are going to appreciate.
							</br>
							</br>
							<b>We want to bring our experience to you.</b> We know that getting into reselling is very difficult, and the steep learning curve has driven many people away. Therefore, we want to offer a service that does it for you. Introducing <b><i>The Hype Fund</i></b> by <b><i>The Hype Advisor</i></b>.

						We are a <b>niche hedge fund</b> that operates specifically in the streetwear market. Using our experience, connections, and data analysis, we buy items that we predict to be <b>bullish</b>: they increase in resell value over time. If you invest with us, we will put your capital into the market to buy and hold streetwear items. At any given time, you can log into your account<sup>1</sup> and check your portfolio, which displays your investments, their current values, and the reasoning behind the choice of each item. When your six-month investing time frame is completed, we will sell the items and transfer your money directly to your <b>PayPal account</b>.
						</br>
						</br>
						During the launch of our service, we will open up a limited number of <b>slots</b>for clients. Clients can invest starting at a low minimum of $100, with the money pooled together for the investment round and utilized to buy a diverse array of streetwear items. Each client then owns a percentage of each item, which translates to a percentage of the total value. Within each pool, we will also contribute a portion of our funds, <b>embarking along the journey with you</b>.
						</br>
						</br>
						At the end of the investing period, we will pay you your profit after taking a performance fee<sup>3</sup> similar to traditional hedge funds. We will also return your original investment with a minimal management fee<sup>3</sup> subtracted (since the acquisition of streetwear items is a tedious process).
						</br>
						</br>
						To stay updated on the launch of our service and sign up for a slot when they release, <b>be sure to <a href="#form" class="scrolly">give us your contact information</a></b>.
						</br>
					</p>
					<div class="asterisk">
						<sup>1</sup>User interface and accounts on our website are still under construction. In the meantime, payments and updates will be coordinated through email and PayPal.
						</br>
						<sup>2</sup>We are not affiliated with StockX, but their website provides a good basis for understanding the value of different items.
						</br>
						<sup>3</sup>Exact fees follow closely with the 2 and 20 rule for hedgefunds. Exact percentages are announced to those on our email list, and these fees are also subject to change, in which case we will notify all potential customers via email and update on our website and contracts.

						<!-- <span class="left" id="chart_div"></span> -->
						<span id="chart" class="left"></span>
						The streetwear industry is a multi-billion industry, with the resell market itself currently valued at <b>$2 billion</b> (per <a href = "https://www.businessinsider.com/most-expensive-sneakers-sold-last-year-resale-2019-4" target="_blank">Business Insider)</a>. This number is only growing at an exponential rate: it is projected to hit <b>$6 billion by 2025</b>. <b>Start investing now, you wonâ€™t regret it</b>.
						</br>
						</br>
						For a glimpse at <b>our track record/profits</b> or <b>the growth of the market and comparisons to the stock market</b>, click the buttons below. Be sure to move your cursor over the graphs to view the numbers!

						Ultimately, the streetwear market is <b>more predictable, less volatile</b>, and thus has a <b>greater potential</b> for profit than other open markets. As an experienced group of resellers and investors in the streetwear market, we can leverage this potential for better returns.

						<h2>Why Believe In Us?</h2>
						<p>Low risk. Consistent earnings.</p>
					</header>
					<p align = "left">
						Our experience with reselling streetwear both individually and as a group have provided us with <b>an eye for the most profitable investments</b> that is matched by few. Using our <b>knowledge and connections</b>, we buy and sell bullish assets at the best deals possible, some of which are very difficult to obtain.
						</br>
						</br>
						The streetwear market is unlike any other. There is a constant influx of new drops every week, providing an abundance of opportunities to invest. The <b>constant demand</b> for valued streetwear items combined with the <b>decreasing supply</b> of brand-new items (as items get worn/used) raises the resell price, making them low-risk investments.
						</br>
						</br>
						We want to show you that streetwear is not just a passion for streetwear enthusiasts, but is also a living, breathing market where millions of dollars have the potential to be made! 
						</br>
						</br>
						If you want to test out how we perform in the market, itâ€™s okay to start small! Our business is structured so each client can contribute, <b>with just a minimum amount of $100.</b>
