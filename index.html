								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>We are a team of streetwear enthusiasts who have been passionate about the world of hype for as long as we can remember. However, we realized that while our closets were getting fuller, our wallets were getting thinner. We wanted to find a way to fund our passion, and discovered reselling: buying certain items for the low, waiting for a calculated period of time, and selling them high. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>Reselling allowed us to make crazy amounts of money and buy what we wanted, when we wanted. After learning the ins and outs of the resell market for streetwear, we want to bring that experience to you. We know that getting into reselling is very difficult, so we wanted to streamline the process. With our experience, data analysis, connections, and economic knowledge, we can help you profit.</p>
